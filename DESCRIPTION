Description: Estimates the parameters of the semiparametric linear transformation model using imputation method, naive method and regression calibration method when time-to-event is interval-censored and a covariate is measured with error. A right censoring indicator must be available. The methods implemented in this package can be found in Mandal, S., Wang, S. and Sinha, S. (2019+). Analysis of Linear Transformation Models with Covariate Measurement Error and Interval Censoring. (accepted, Statistics In Medicine).
